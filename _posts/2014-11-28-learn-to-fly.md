One of my proudest accomplishments thus far is earing my pilot's certificate. Just one hundred years ago, man had barely taken its first leap into the sky. Now, I can strap myself—and others, too—into a several ton piece of metal and take to the skies, wherever and whenever I want.

Many people have asked me about earning their certificate—what the process is like, what abilities you are afforded, and more. Here’s a quick overview.

## What can you do with a pilot’s license?

In short, fly a plane.

The long answer is a little more complicated. The FAA offers a graduated scale of “ratings”, their term for the various types of certificate. Each offers an extended set of privileges. There are additional intricacies (for instance, the distinction between airplanes, helicopters, and more), but we’ll neglect those for simplicity.

Every pilot begins as a student pilot. A student pilot’s certificate affords them the ability to fly an airplane with an instructor, or alone (no passengers) with an instructor’s signature (this is called a solo).

A student may then earn their sport pilot or private pilot rating. There is a distinction between the two—generally speaking, unless you are unable to earn a private pilot’s certificate due to medical reasons (this will be discussed with you at the appropriate time), there is no reason not to earn a private pilot’s license.

Once you have a private pilot’s license, your freedoms are much less restricted. You may fly, at the start, any airplane (there may be additional restrictions to rent) with passengers in visual flight rules (conditions). There are some intricacies here, but in general, as long as you can see the ground and are not paying less than a pro-rata share of your flight expenses, you’ll be in the green.

Private pilots can then move on by adding additional endorsements—for instance, the privilege to fly tailwheel airplanes or complex airplanes (those with retractable landing gear, amongst other characteristics), additional privileges—sea planes, or multi-engine planes, or additional ratings—the instrument rating allows one to fly with reference to instruments (“in the clouds”), the commercial rating allows one to be paid to fly, and more.

Many private pilots do earn the instrument rating, but most don’t continue beyond this unless they’re looking to make a career of it.

As a private pilot, you can, in short, fly any small, single engine plane carrying up to four or six people.

## How does learning work?

There are two primary components to flight training—ground work and air work. Ground work will consist of one-on-one instruction  with your instructor, as well as self-study for the oral and written exams.

Air work will consist of learning flight maneuvers—straight and level flight, turns, climbs, descents—as well as other items—stall recovery, emergency procedures, and navigation techniques. You are required to fly at least 20 hours with an instructor and 10 hours alone, with a minimum of at least 40 hours of flight time. Most students take closer to 55 or 60 hours—those in busier airspace, like Los Angeles, where I learned, may take more as they learn the intricacies of this as well.

You’ll spend a lot of time in the same aircraft (or type of aircraft, at least) learning the intricacies of flight, this airplane, and your airspace. In the process, you’ll complete quite a few unassisted take-offs and landings, complete at least ten landings (and three hours of flight) at night, and fly at least 75 nautical miles alone—I flew from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara.

## What’s the test like?

There’s three testing components to the process.

The first is the written exam. This is a 50 to 60 question, multiple-choice test covering the basics of flight, flight planning, and navigation. The FAA [publishes a very representative sample of these questions](http://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/test_guides/media/faa-g-8082-17i.pdf) (these are mostly the exact questions, but with different answer ordering), and many turn to rote memorization to learn the concepts. The written exam is taken prior to your practical test—many flight schools require students to take and pass the exam prior to their first solo.

The second is the practical test, which comes in two parts. First is the oral exam. The FAA [again provides a guide to these questions](http://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/test_guides/media/faa-g-8082-17i.pdf), but your experience will depend on your designated pilot examiner (DPE). My DPE covered nearly every question in the guide over a period of around three hours.

Last, but not least, is the flight practical test. The FAA, again, [documents these maneuvers exactly](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/test_standards/media/FAA-S-8081-14B.pdf). This took me about two hours, from Santa Monica to El Monte to Whiteman to Burbank and back. It’s very low pressure—your examiner whats you to demonstrate your skills as a safe and competent pilot, and will be forthcoming with feedback. You will know if you did not pass, and will be given the option to continue maneuvers.

Should you fail to meet the standards for a particular knowledge area or maneuver, you will be able to re-test this particular area (and any others that you chose to not cover after being informed of your failure) within 90 days to earn your certificate. Should you not demonstrate competency in those areas, you’ll need to re-take the entire test.

## How much does it cost?

This will vary depending on what you choose to train in, and how much time you take. In my case, I spent about $200 on books and other materials, and $120/hr for flight time (plus $60/hr for instruction), for a grand total of around $7000. Different flight schools charge different rates for instructors and airplanes, based on market rates and particular airplane costs (a brand new airplane costs more to run, and thus train in, than a 1968 Cessna 172).

## Where can I get started?

The chemistry between you and your instructor is extremely important. Before you commit to instruction, look to Google and Yelp to locate the flight schools as your local airport. Most will offer an introductory flight for around $100, where you can meet the instructors, learn about the airplane, and fly for twenty or thirty minutes—you’ll get to control the airplane.

If you’re interested, go try and intro flight with a flight school or two, and meet instructors from every local flight school. I tried three instructors before I settled on my final one, and I encourage you to do the same. And, if things aren’t working out—you feel like you aren’t progressing, availability is a problem, or the chemistry just isn’t there—don’t be afraid to try a new instructor or a new flight school.
