Earlier this year, I happened upon the Center for Unidentified and Missing Persons [Unidentified Persons Index](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/uid-chrono-index.html). I was struck by the sheer volume of reports in the database&mdash;since 1900, there have been *over four thousand* unidentified persons recovered and added to the database.

Information can tell us a lot. The format provided by the Center isn't particularly useful, so I wrote [a small tool](https://github.com/pcrumm/doe-analyzer) that extracted this information, attempted to parse it, and stored it in a more useful format. Here's what I found.

<hr>

## Genders
The United States is [slightly female-skewed](http://www.geohive.com/earth/pop_gender.aspx) across the entire population. A quick look shows that our Doe database is not quite so even. There's a nearly 2:1 skew towards men in our dataset.

This is in line with the [male-favoring](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv12.pdf) distribution of violent crime victims (numbers represented below are per 1,000 age twelve or older, so there's not a fair straight comparison).

Still, general violent crime statistics are not skewed nearly 2:1 as our Doe database is. Men are, evidently, much more likely to be discovered deceased and unidentified.

## Locations
Geographic distribution proves equally telling. Violent crime in the United States is fairly evenly geographically distributed, but tends to favor the west coast (and, to a lesser extent, the Midwest) over others&mdash;likely due to the proliferation of gang violence.

Our Doe map, on the other hand, shows a distribution that heavily favors a few noteworthy states: California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida.

It's difficult to ascertain a cause for this. These states are amongst the most populous, but the Doe discovery rate is disproportional for all but California.

## Races

The Doe database classifies race very simply, based on the skeletal characteristics of Does. This is a little unreliable, and does not represent well mixed race individuals. Classifications are made as White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, or "Other".

<span class="img-caption">Racial Distribution of Does</span>

While [American race distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicity) does favor "White" races, we do see that Hispanic and Black individuals are over-represented in our dataset compared to the national average. This is in line with the traditional over-representation of these races in violent crimes, as the violent crime report indicates:

## Racial Distribution By Location

Of most interest in this dataset is race distribution by location. This is particularly interesting in states with higher number of Does&mdash;for our analysis, we examine California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida.

<span class="img-caption">Racial Distribution By State For Selected States</span>

Of particular note is the over-representation of minorities in many of these states, most notably Arizona, where Hispanic Does outnumber all others nearly 2:1. That is a substantial discrepancy, and may be attributable to the immigration epidemic in the state. A cursory analysis of the original database notes that many of these discovered individuals were discovered in the desert of southern Arizona.

## Conclusion
There's a lot happening in the Doe dataset. It's difficult to speculate as to the cause, but it is obvious that males and minorities are particularly over-represented unidentified individuals with possibly suspicious deaths. Some blame this concentration, [particularly along the border](https://nacla.org/article/lost-system-unidentified-bodies-border) on immigration, but the quantity of Does in the rest of the nation is equally troubling.
