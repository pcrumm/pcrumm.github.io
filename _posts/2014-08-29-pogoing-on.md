Moving on is never easy. I, like most people, I think, don't enjoy change. The comfort of the known and the familiar is tough to give up, no matter the circumstances.

I've spent my last two years as a proud member of [Automattic](http://automattic.com), known mostly as the creator of WordPress.com and Akismet, and the caretaker of Gravatar. I've been incredibly fortunate to work with a talented and passionate group of individuals that's somehow kept its culture and fire alive even as its doubled in size.

Though the decision wasn't easy, I've opted to turn into the keys to my remote office and move to a more traditional, "old-fashioned" role. I'll be joining [Pogoseat](http://pogoseat.com) to help make the live event ticketing status quo a little better, and to make your experience at these events even more awesome. While I'll miss each and every one of my coworkers at Automattic, I'm excited to face the challenges ahead.

Thank you to each and every person I've encountered as part of the WordPress community within the last two years. In particular, I'd like to thank my colleagues on the [VIP team](http://vip.wordpress.com), who are the most intelligent and passionate (not to mention fun) group I've encountered this far in my life. You guys are awesome, and every moment I've spent working with you has taught me so much.

Keep up the good work, and don't be a stranger.
