blurb: The Old-Fashioned Way

There’s no better way to motivate a developer to speak than to ask about their workflow—the tools they use, the habits they’ve formed, and the platforms they can’t live without. I’ve spent the last several years floating through a variety of different setups, and have finally landed on one that I’ve left (mostly) alone for quite some time. As a developer primarily focused on back-end development (PHP, Ruby, Javascript) and occasionally front-end (React.js, LESS), I’ve configured my environment to save me time; that said, most of these tools are generic enough that they ought to be useful to most.

# Philosophy
I’d like to be able to work anywhere, anytime, on any machine, with minimal configuration effort. I have a longstanding dream of picking up something like a cheap Chromebook (or perhaps an old Thinkpad with Linux tossed on it), which I can use as my day-to-day carry, supplemented by a more powerful Linux desktop and Macbook when appropriate. I’m not quite there yet, mostly out of my own laziness, but I do my best to select tools and platforms that will keep me close to that goal.

Ideologically, I’d prefer to stay away from products created large, user-is-the-product organizations like Google, Apple, Facebook, and the link, but at this point their offerings are so simple, ubiquitous, and engrained into both my habits and the habits of others that I’ve currently given this up as a lost cause.

# Hardware
I’m currently rocking an 11” Macbook Air for personal use, and a 13” Retina Macbook Pro for work use. Whichever I’m using at the current point in time is usually hooked up to a cheap 23” monitor. I keep meaning to come up with a more ergonomic setup (with a mouse and keyboard), but I haven’t worked out how to make switching between the two laptops efficient without having to plug in fifteen different devices.

I’m starting to regret purchasing an 11” Air for personal use and personal dev work; I do like the size profile, but it’s awfully underpowered when trying to do any sort of multi-tasking: even running Safari with a few tabs, Slack, and iTerm with my remote development environment is a struggle sometimes.

I also have a recently-custom built desktop that serves as a dual-purpose gaming and development machine (runs Windows and Ubuntu), but it’s currently sitting neglected. 

# Day-to-Day
I’m deeply embedded in the Google ecosystem. I use Gmail for my personal and business email accounts (and the corresponding app for my iPhone), Google Calendar, Google Docs and Google Spreadsheets. I haven’t found a similar platform that enables me to access my email accounts conveniently from any platform, that has a workable web experience, and that integrates well with Contact and Calendar products. I’m absolutely all ears, in case you have!

Continuing on the communication train, we run across the one piece of platform dependency that I can’t shake: iMessage. I’ve “switched” to Android a half dozen times over the last few years, but always end up back on an iPhone due to the simple cross-device synchronization that iMessage does so well. I haven’t been able to convince my friends and family to switch to another platform (and haven’t really tried), so until someone reverse-engineers their way to an iMessage client on Android, this isn’t too likely to change.

As far as personal productivity goes, I’m a big fan of [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com) to track all of my todos. I’ve tried much heavier (and more expensive) clients like The Hit List, but Wunderlist does what I need for a very nice price (free). I don’t track my day-to-day tasks in it, but instead use it as reminders for things like bills and groceries.

For general brain dumping, I’m a big fan of Evernote. I use it for personal and work purposes (separate accounts, though), and have about three dozen notebooks between the two accounts with all sorts of information. It’s hard to beat the cross-device support and the ability to search and store _everything_.

To get around online, I use Safari for personal use (it’s a lot more power efficient than Chrome), and Chrome for work and development use. I only use an adblocker, so I’m fairly browser agnostic. I switched away from Firefox a few months ago because its battery usage was getting ridiculous.

## OS/X Apps I Can’t Live Without
Even though my goal is to be platform independent, I’m not quite there yet. There are a few OS/X apps that I use on a pretty regular basis, so it’s only fair to give them some love.

[iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer/mac/) is my text editor of choice. It’s lightweight, simple, and supports Markdown. It does everything I need to do, and not much else—what more can you ask for from a text editor?

For email on my personal laptop, I’m a fan of [Airmail 2](http://airmailapp.com). I usually keep work email open in a pinned tab, but I manage about a half-dozen non-work related accounts, and it’s handy to have them all in one place. Its Gmail support is fantastic, and it seems to not abuse system resources and battery like other clients I’ve tried.

To consolidate all of my calendars, I use [Sunrise Calendar](https://calendar.sunrise.am), but haven’t been too satisfied since Microsoft bought it. The cross-device integration is nice, but it’s pretty resource hungry on both of my laptops.

I use [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com) as my terminal emulator, as it’s the only one I’ve found that supports more than 256 colors on OS/X.

I’m constantly tweaking my workflow and tools, and always love suggestions. I’m particularly looking for a better calendar program, and a Gmail alternative—let’s hear them!
