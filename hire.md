I'm currently happily employed as an engineer for [Automattic](http://automattic.com), perhaps best known as the creators of WordPress.com and as one of the world's first (and largest) totally distributed companies. That said, if you have an offer that you think might interest me, I'd [love to hear from you](/contact).

I am based in Los Angeles, California currently, and would prefer positions that do not require relocation&mdash;totally remote positions are best. Still, I am open to other offers.

If you'd like more information on my work history, please [take a look at my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pcrumm). Otherwise, [contact me](/contact).
