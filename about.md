My foray into the world of technology began with a futile attempt to build a web portal for use on my Playstation Portable back in 2002. Though the homepage never came to fruition, I was exposed to the magical world of dynamic scripting through PHP.

My interest in PHP lead me to [phpBB](http://phpbb.com), a popular open-source forum solution. Working with phpBB, I discovered the rest of the LAMP stack&mdash;Apache and MySQL. I eventually became a part of the phpBB team, and developed several internal tools, and the [Support Toolkit](https://www.phpbb.com/support/stk/), a widely used tool for debugging and maintaining phpBB forums.

phpBB lead me to the world of [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), the world's most used blogging and content management system. I soon found work with [Automattic](http://automattic.com), the enetity behind [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com). I now work as a VIP Wrangler, where I intermix engineering and personal skills to provide code review and world class developer support to some of the biggest names in media.

In my free time, I've kept my skills sharp through a variety of other technology [projects](/[projects]). Away from screens, I enjoy playing guitar, and am an avid recreational private pilot.
