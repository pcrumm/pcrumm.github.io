My foray into the world of technology began with a futile attempt to build a web portal for use on my Playstation Portable back in 2002. Though the homepage never came to fruition, I was exposed to the magical world of dynamic scripting through PHP.

My interest in PHP lead me to [phpBB](http://phpbb.com), a popular open-source forum solution. Working with phpBB, I discovered the rest of the LAMP stack&mdash;Apache and MySQL. I eventually became a part of the phpBB team, and developed several internal tools, and the [Support Toolkit](https://www.phpbb.com/support/stk/), a widely used tool for debugging and maintaining phpBB forums.

phpBB lead me to the world of [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), the world's most used blogging and content management system. I soon found work with [Automattic](http://automattic.com), the entity behind [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com). Most recently, I worked as a VIP Wrangler, where I intermix engineering and personal skills to provide code review and world class developer support to some of the biggest names in media.

I then moved on to [Pogoseat](http://pogoseat.com), where I worked to redevelop a legacy, PHP-based stack into a well-architected, well-tested react.js application built upon a node.js-backed API.

I've since migrated down to San Diego and joined [10up](http://10up.com), where I work as a Senior Web Strategist to define and plan engineering projects from clients that intersect enterprise, media, and more.

In my free time, I've kept my skills sharp through a variety of other technology [projects](/projects). Away from screens, I enjoy fitness and am an avid recreational private pilot.
